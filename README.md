A simple console app to test web api's

Got tired of postman, and just wanted something that don't make me touch the mouse to test an api.

Also I wanted to be able to save it in github, and reuse it and have control over it.

And most of all I wanted to be simple

To build project: 
```
dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-arm64 --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=true
```
NOTE: from time to time I come back here to make some improvements and the project is just a hoppy :)
